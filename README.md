# Arctouch's code challenge

## Client

I did choose React over Vue(the framework I was working) to show some knowledge with yours stack. I'm a little outdated and didn't use Hooks. Got redux-starter-kit to make state control less verbose.
The Upcoming route at TMDb returns some old movies so I treated this in the frontend, I think this is backend responsability but I tried to maintain the pagination simple.

To run:
```
git checkout dev
npm install
npm start
```
